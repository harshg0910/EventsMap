Server [in JSP]
 - Each authenticated user has login details & can login on server, & post 
	event news. These users can be anyone of the club secys or hostel
	authorities etc.
 	Added security features in the Login Class & Server ER-Diagram.

Client [JAVA Application]
 - Client has an application installed for interfacing with the Server
	This application fetches information from the server & displays
	events on the map, based on client's personalized favourites &
	categories.
	Notifications for updated events in favourites category.
	Reminders for the events selected by user.

 - For syncing the news, we keep a local cache on client's machine & whenever
	client gets connected to the server, we fetch events ending after current time.

 	If client is always connected to the server, client has the option to  manually
		update or client polls server for the updates [MAY BE INEFFICIENT
		BUT FOR THE TIME BEING WE'LL WORK WITH IT]
